You are working on a production home care management web app.

This app targets:
- UK domiciliary care agencies
- Registered Managers and Care Managers
- Small to medium care providers

Key insight from Google Trends:
- Users search “home care app” more than “home care software”
- “Care management app” is a strong secondary term
- “Care management software” should be used for trust and compliance language, not headlines

Tone requirements:
- Plain English
- Non-technical
- Care-sector specific
- Trust-building
- CQC-focused
- UK-first language

Do NOT use:
- Generic SaaS buzzwords
- Silicon Valley language
- Overly technical descriptions

Do NOT:
- Change layout
- Change components
- Change styling
- Change routes
- Change pricing

ONLY update visible text content on the homepage.


1. Primary keyword to lead with:
   "Home Care Management App"

2. Secondary supporting terms (sprinkle naturally):
   - care management app
   - home care app
   - care management software
   - CQC compliant care software
   - eMAR software

3. Never remove CQC references — strengthen them.

4. Replace feature-first language with outcome-first language:
   - Less admin
   - Fewer missed visits
   - Faster inspections
   - Clear evidence
   - Less stress for managers

5. Write for:
   - A Registered Manager under inspection pressure
   - A Care Coordinator managing rotas
   - A Carer using a phone on visits

6. Keep sentences short.
7. Avoid marketing fluff.
8. Sound human, calm, and professional.
