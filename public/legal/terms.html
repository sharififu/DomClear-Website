<h2>5. Subscriptions and payment</h2>
<p>5.1 Subscriptions may be monthly or annual and can be cancelled anytime in accordance with our subscription and billing processes.</p>
<p>5.2 Fees are as set out at the time of subscription. We may change fees on reasonable notice; continued use after the change constitutes acceptance.</p>

<p>5.4 Refunds are handled in line with our refund policy as stated at purchase or on request from info@domi-clear.com.</p>

<h2>7. Data and privacy</h2>
<p>Your use of the Service is subject to our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy. Where we process personal data on your behalf (e.g. as a Data Processor for your organisation), our Data Processing terms apply. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service and any data you upload complies with applicable data protection law (including UK GDPR).</p>
<h2>8. Your content and responsibilities</h2>
<p>You retain ownership of content you upload. You grant us the licence necessary to operate the Service (e.g. to store, display, and back up your data). You warrant that you have the right to upload such content and that it does not infringe any third-party rights or our Acceptable Use Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy or legality of content you provide.</p>
<h2>9. Our intellectual property</h2>
<p>DomiClear, the DomiClear logo, and the software and design of the Service are our intellectual property. You may not copy, modify, or reverse-engineer the Service except as permitted by law or with our written consent.</p>
<h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>10.1 The Service is provided &quot;as is&quot;. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>
<p>10.2 To the fullest extent permitted by law, we exclude liability for indirect, consequential, or special loss, loss of profit, data, or goodwill, and our total liability for any claim arising from or in connection with the Service shall not exceed the fees paid by you in the twelve months before the claim.</p>
<p>10.3 Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.</p>

<h2>13. Changes to these terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes (e.g. by email or in-app notice). Continued use of the Service after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.</p>
<h2>14. General</h2>
<p>14.1 These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and DomiClear regarding the Service.</p>
<p>14.2 If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.</p>
<p>14.3 Our failure to enforce any right does not waive that right.</p>
